        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m in 10th grade and always curious about how things work. I like learning about tech and creative stuff, especially when I can explore it on my own. I enjoy messing around with ideas, figuring things out, and just seeing where it takes me. I’m not perfect, but I learn a lot from trying and messing up. Outside of school, I like to keep things chill and follow whatever I’m into at the moment.
